                            <p>Drought and water scarcity are no longer distant concerns but pressing issues affecting livelihoods. As the demand for sustainable water consumption rises, the answer lies in accessible and affordable solutions. Enter water sensor technology, promising a clearer picture of our water usage and paving the way for a more sustainable future.</p>
                            <p>At Crodeon, we believe that every company, regardless of size, should have the power to make a difference. Join us on this blog as we unveil the incredible benefits of our water usage monitoring device, backed by real customer success.</p>
                            <h2>What is a water usage monitoring device?</h2>
                            <p>A device to monitor your water consumption serves to measure how much water you use or what your peak usage is. It can also measure groundwater level to see what impact your irrigation methods have on the local soil.</p>
                            <h2>Why should you consider using a water consumption sensor?</h2>
                            <p>Water sensor technology plays a crucial role in monitoring water usage, particularly in the agricultural sector. It is essential to have a water usage sensor to provide verifiable data to government agencies regarding the amount of water, both from groundwater and tap sources, that has been utilised.</p>
                            <p><strong>By exceeding the permitted limits of groundwater pumping or tap water consumption, you run the risk of facing fines or sanctions.</strong></p>
                            <h2>What happens if you don't monitor water usage?</h2>
                            <p>When you neglect to monitor your water consumption you don't only risk being fined. Freely watering your fields often means over-irrigation. As farmers and fruit growers don't want to risk ruining their harvest, they rather give a little more water than not enough.</p>
                            <p>This is an understandable point of view, but sadly does not lead to sustainable water usage as it wastes water and your money.</p>

                            <h2>The solution for affordable sustainable water consumption</h2>
                            <p>In recent months, our farmers and fruit growers have faced significant challenges. The need for technological solutions to optimise and measure water consumption has become increasingly apparent. It's not just large industrial companies that must take action to conserve water in the face of scarcity.</p>
                            <p>A crucial component in this effort is an accurate and affordable water usage monitor. Unfortunately, such installations can cost a fortune, which is not feasible for the independent farmer. To overcome this obstacle, we need an affordable water measurement sensor that can be easily installed and maintained by farmers themselves.</p>

                            <h2>About the database</h2>
                            <p>The IEA Demonstration Projects Database seeks to map major demonstration projects of clean energy technologies, globally. For each project, it provides information on location, sector and technology grouping, status, capacity, timing and funding, when available.</p>
                            <h2>Without a major acceleration in clean energy innovation, reaching net zero emissions by 2050 will not be possible</h2>
                            <p>Technologies that are available on the market today are able to provide nearly all of the emissions reductions required by 2030 in the Net Zero Emissions by 2050 scenario. However, going all the way to net zero will require faster innovation and the widespread use after 2030 of technologies that are still under development today. This is particularly true in hard-to-decarbonise sectors such as heavy industry and long-distance transportation. The IEA monitors the development of over 550 individual technology designs and components across the whole energy system that contribute to reaching net-zero emissions in the Clean Energy Technology Guide.</p>
                            <h2>What is a demonstration project?</h2>
                            <p>The innovation process involves successive demonstrations of scientific concepts, working prototypes, and consumer demand. A “demonstration project”, according to common usage in the energy sector, is typically one of the first few examples of a new technology being introduced onto a given market at the size of a single full-scale commercial unit. It involves far more time, cost and risk than a prototype, and significantly reduces investor risk for subsequent installations. Demonstration projects are usually loss-making investments when considered in isolation, with their combination of capital requirement and risk placing them squarely within what is often referred to as the “valley of death’’, a stage when technologies can fail to progress commercially even if they have high market potential. The IEA estimates that at least USD 90 billion of public funding needs to be raised by 2026 to complete a portfolio of demonstration projects for technologies that could be commercially ready by 2030 and contribute to achieving net zero emissions by mid-century.</p>

                            <h2>About Food Wastage</h2>
                    <p>Food waste is a massive problem in our society — especially restaurant food waste. </p>
                    <p>Inefficiencies in the U.S. food system result in nearly 40% of the country’s food supply going unsold or uneaten. And the food service industry generates approximately 13 million tons of food waste in the United States, which mostly come from restaurants.</p>
                    <h2>What causes restaurant food waste?</h2>
                    <p>Several different factors contribute to restaurant food waste. The four most common reasons for food waste include:</p>
                    <h5>1. Spoilage</h5>
                    <p>Food can become unfit for consumption due to improper handling, storage, or packaging. Common examples include improper refrigeration, over-ordering, and poor restaurant inventory management methods.</p>
                    <h5>2. Miscalculated portions</h5>
                    <p>Incorrect or inconsistent kitchen training can lead to larger portion sizes than planned. As much as it may please customers to have leftovers to bring home, you risk creating more waste—and losing valuable margin on the plates.</p>
                    <h5>3. Food spillage</h5>
                    <p>Food spillage is quite common in restaurants. It can include anything from a server dropping a tray of food in the dining room during food service to a prep cook accidentally knocking over their cutting board. Those mistakes, no matter how small, can add up to large monetary losses.</p>
                    <h5>4. Refires</h5>
                    <p>Refires occur when a plate of food is sent back to the kitchen and needs to be remade. Maybe a diner received the incorrect order, they failed to mention they’re allergic to something, or the food wasn’t prepared to their liking. Whatever the reason for the refire, it’s costing your kitchen twice as much to make one plate.</p>
                    
                    <h2>How to track food waste in restaurants</h2>
                    <p>Monitoring and documenting every instance of food waste at your restaurant is vital not only for better food cost control, but also for overall restaurant accounting best practices. You’ll get much more visibility into why your restaurant cost of goods sold (COGS) numbers aren’t adding up the way they should and why inventory values are off.</p>
                    <p>Food waste management initiatives can be as simple as updating a spreadsheet every time a waste event occurs. Simply set a sheet up with columns for the ingredient or recipe that was wasted, the date and time of the event, the name of the employee responsible for the waste, and an area for additional comments or context.</p>
                    <p>Once a tracker is set up, you can use it to find patterns in waste events. For example, if food waste from refires regularly increases on days when a certain front of house employee is working, it may indicate they’re making mistakes that can be fixed with additional training.</p>
                    <p>However, manual food waste tracking does not account for the monetary value of what was lost.</p>
                    <p>Luckily, software for food waste tracking combined with real-time invoice data makes it easy to see exactly how much those mistakes cost the business.</p>
                    <h2>Conduct a waste audit </h2>
                    <p>Without conducting a waste audit, there is no way of truly knowing the amount of food waste your restaurant is tossing out as a result of your current operations and what your potential cost savings are to help your bottom line.</p>
                    <p>This does mean you’re going to have to roll up your sleeves and go through the trash.</p>
                    <p>Every day for one week, before you prepare your trash for pick up, have a team open the bags and sort out the trash into the following categories:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Paper goods (paper towels, napkins, promos/flyers, etc.)</li>
                        <li>Takeout products (cups, plates, containers, etc.)</li>
                        <li>Produce (fruits, veggies)</li>
                        <li>Meat (this can include poultry and fish, besides red meat)</li>
                        <li>Plastics</li>
                        <li>Other (aluminum foil, broken plates, etc.)</li>
                    </ul>
